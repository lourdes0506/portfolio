  <h2>PROJECTS</h2>

  <div class="project">
    <h3 class="project-title">1. Mealshare</h2>
    <p class="project-desc">MealShare is a social impact platform developed to connect restaurants
     and event organizers with NGOs to reduce food waste and combat hunger. 
     It allows verified donors to list surplus food and enables NGOs to claim and collect it efficiently. 
     The system includes real-time notifications, authentication, and proof of distribution. 
     This initiative promotes sustainable food practices while supporting underprivileged communities.
</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3 class="project-title">2. Avian Acoustics: Deep Learning for Bird Species Identification and Classification from Vocalizations</h2>
    <p class="project-desc">Avian Acoustics is an AI-powered system designed to identify 
      and classify bird species based on their vocalizations. 
      By using deep learning models like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
       the system analyzes audio recordings and detects bird species even in noisy environments. 
       This solution supports researchers and conservationists in monitoring bird populations 
       and biodiversity without direct human intervention. It offers a scalable, accurate
       and cost-effective method for ecological research and wildlife protection.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3 class="project-title">3. Nutrient NPK Sensing and Monitoring System in Hydroponics</h3>
    <p class="project-desc">Nutrient NPK Sensing and Monitoring System in Hydroponics is designed to track 
      the levels of essential nutrients—Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K)—in a soilless farming setup. 
      The system uses sensors to detect nutrient imbalances in real time and alerts the user for corrective action. 
      This ensures healthy plant growth, improves yield quality, and reduces nutrient waste. 
      It's a smart, efficient solution for sustainable and precise agriculture
    
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="project">
    <h3 class="project-title">4. Motion Detection By Image Processing</h3>
    <p class="project-desc">A computer vision-based system was developed to detect motion by analyzing differences between 
      consecutive video frames. Using image processing techniques like background subtraction, it accurately identifies 
      movement in real time. The system is well-suited for surveillance, smart monitoring, and automated alerts. 
      It ensures high reliability by minimizing false detections caused by environmental noise or lighting changes.
    This project demonstrates the effective use of real-time image analysis for intelligent and responsive security solutions.</p>

  <h2>INTERNSHIPS</h2>

  <div class="project">
    <h3 class="project-title">1. Hyundai Motors – Line Safety Automation</h3>
    <p class="project-desc">At Hyundai Motors, we developed a sensor-based safety system that integrated motion and temperature sensors 
      to detect human presence and halt machinery when safety lines were crossed. This system enhanced worker safety by minimizing 
      false triggers and ensuring accurate human detection. Following implementation, we collected and analyzed operational data 
      from before and after the system was deployed. Using Microsoft Power BI, we created a comprehensive dashboard to visually compare 
      the effectiveness and impact of the safety solution. The internship provided valuable experience in automation, sensor integration 
      and data-driven analysis. It also highlighted the importance of safety compliance in industrial environments.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3 class="project-title">2. Southern Railways – Speaker & CCTV System</h3>
    <p class="project-desc">As part of the internship at Southern Railways, we designed and installed a complete speaker system 
      for a railway-operated school, ensuring clear and effective communication across the premises. We also troubleshooted and 
      resolved a critical issue in the CCTV surveillance system at the railway hospital, restoring its monitoring functionality. 
      Additionally, we studied the live announcement system at Chennai Central railway station, gaining insight into 
      how real-time audio relays are managed across platforms. The internship provided practical exposure to public infrastructure 
      systems, technical problem-solving, and audio-visual integration. It also strengthened our understanding of safety 
      protocols and system maintenance in government institutions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="project">
    <h3 class="project-title">3. Verzeo – IoT-Based Risk Assessment</h3>
    <p class="project-desc">During the Verzeo IoT Internship, we explored the application of Internet of Things (IoT) in real-world 
      risk assessment scenarios. We designed a prototype system using sensors to detect and monitor environmental risks such as gas leaks 
      and abnormal temperature levels. The system was programmed to trigger alerts in real time, helping prevent hazardous incidents. 
      We also worked on integrating the collected sensor data with cloud platforms for continuous monitoring and remote access. 
      This internship deepened our understanding of embedded systems, sensor networks, and IoT-based safety solutions. 
      It strengthened our skills in combining hardware and software for smart risk management.</p>
